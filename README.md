Classifying Hip-Hop and Rock Music Using Machine Learning and Audio Feature Analysis.
Strengths
âœ… Well-defined Problem Statement â€“ Clearly addresses how streaming services use audio analysis for music classification.
âœ… Dataset Choice â€“ The Echo Nest dataset is a solid choice for genre classification.
âœ… Feature Selection â€“ Using features like danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, and speechiness is a smart approach.
âœ… Model Selection & Comparison â€“ Evaluating multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) helps in identifying the best one.
âœ… Results & Evaluation â€“ Achieving ~85% accuracy with Random Forest is impressive.

Areas for Improvement & Future Work
ðŸ”¹ Dataset Expansion

The Echo Nest dataset is great, but try combining it with datasets like GTZAN or FMA (Free Music Archive) for better generalization.

ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering

Include Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and spectral contrast for deeper audio analysis.

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature redundancy.

ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning Integration

Consider using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify spectrogram images of audio.

Try LSTMs or Transformers for sequential audio data processing.

ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimize the Random Forest model using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization to improve accuracy beyond 85%.

ðŸ”¹ Real-time Deployment

Convert this project into a Flask/Django web app that allows users to upload songs for classification.

ðŸ”¹ Visualization & Interpretability

Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or feature importance plots to explain model decisions.

Plot confusion matrix to analyze classification errors.
